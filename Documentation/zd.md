# Zhengdu Screen reader: Official User's Manual; Version 1.6.2.0

## Introduction

### Preface

Welcome to the official user's manual for the Zhengdu Screen reader,
known also as ZDSR throughout the rest of this document. This book shall serve
as a complete guide for the Zhengdu Screen reader, all its features, functions
and use cases, but shall also serve as an instruction and a guidebook for
sighted teachers, trainers, assistants, and parents wanting to understand how
blind people operate computers.

The book's design allows reading either chapter by chapter, or just specific
chapters needed by the user. This approach allows novice users to slowly
familiarize themselves with all the terms and operation methods, while letting
the intermediate and advanced users skip straight to the specific chapters
concerning their specific needs.

We sincerely hope that you will enjoy this manual and the software itself and
that Zhengdu Screen reader will improve and enrich your daily life.

Let's strive for perfection together!

### What is a screen reader?

Putting it simply, a screen reader is a software program installed on the user's
computer that "reads the screen". What it exactly means though is that the
application installed on the computer collects textual or even non-textual
information and conveys it to the user via another application installed on the
computer that is called a Text To Speech engine or TTS in short. There are many
Text to Speech engines available on the market. They differ in their voice,
pronunciation and of course price. Do not worry though, the latest version of
the Microsoft Windows operating system contains many voices in many languages,
so your computer is most probably "able to speak by default". If you are using an older
version of Windows though, you will need some special preparation before using
the screen reader.

If you speak English, Russian, Ukrainian or Esperanto we recommend the [RH
Voice](https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice/releases) Text to Speech
Engine. It is free and has some clear voices to choose from. In any other case
we can recommend [ESpeak](https://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/). The
robotic voice of this engine requires some training to get used to, but in
return it provides over 80 languages to choose from.

### Why ZDSR?

You might be wondering, if there are so many screen readers to choose from, why
choose this one amongst its competition? The list of notable features is
outlined below. Keep in mind though that this is just a little taste of what
you are going to see later.

- Speed of operation: blind people have slower access to computers than their
sighted counterparts. ZDSR developed an extremely fast speech engine
increasing the reaction speed by about 300% comparing to its competition. This
makes ZDSR a perfect choice for people who need to access the information as
fast as possible.

- Ease of use: ZDSR is built on top of an extremely logical and straightforward
foundation, allowing people of all levels of computer knowledge to master the
product quickly and efficiently, making it possible to install it and start
working immediately.

- Advanced and well-thought functionality: ZDSR has all the functions you need,
plus many more! With the built-in translation, Optical Character Recognition,
automatic labeling of controls and plethora of many different features carrying
out even the most advanced tasks will no longer be a problem.

- Great support for professional software: Are you a writer, programmer, data
analyst or an audio engineer? ZDSR has you covered. With its great support for software like Visual Studio, Android Studio, Eclipse, MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint
and many more the software is not only read perfectly, but also starts being
friendlier to the user with many additional keyboard commands.

As you can see there are many reasons why you should choose ZDSR over any other
screen reading product available on the market.

### ZDSR editions and differences between them

The product is available in six different editions. They differ in
functionality, recommended use environment and the method of activation. All of
them are outlined below with their short descriptions. The full breakdown of all
the differences will be outlined in the table further down this chapter.

- ZDSR Public Welfare Edition: This is the free edition of the screen reader.
It has only the basic functionality required to operate the computer
successfully. Its use is recommended when you need the computer to carry out
only the basic tasks and you do not have the money to buy the higher-end
edition.

- ZDSR Youth edition: The most affordable (costing 10 dollars) edition of the
screen reader. It contains basic features like the Public Welfare edition,
plus some useful extras which can boost your productivity. This edition of
the screen reader uses the online activation method, meaning that only the
Internet connection is required to use the program.

- ZDSR Youth Plus Edition: This edition of ZDSR contains many features
available in the highest possible edition. If you do not need support for
the professional software like MS Office or Reaper, this version will most
probably meet your requirements. - This edition of the screen reader uses
the online activation method, meaning that only the Internet connection is
required to use the program.

- ZDSR Youth Pro edition: This edition contains most features found in the
commercial edition, including support for all of the professional software
like REAPER or MS Office. It is missing some advanced and diverse features
such as "Screen Navigation", but this edition is sufficient for most general
and professional use cases. - This edition of the screen reader uses the
online activation method, meaning that only the Internet connection is
required to use the program.

- ZDSR commercial edition: This edition of the program contains all features
from the previous editions plus some features unique to it, like the
forementioned "Screen navigation". What's more this version of the program
does not need Internet connection to function, as it uses a special device
called a Dongle which is plugged in to your computer and serves as the
authorization key.

- ZDSR Local Network Edition: This edition of the software contains the exact
same feature set as the commercial edition. The only difference is that this
edition is more suitable to use in schools, libraries, and other public
institutions, as it can be running on multiple computers connected to the
same master computer through the network.

As you can see, there are many editions of the program meeting different
needs for different users. Shall you need any help choosing a right edition
for your use case, do not hesitate to contact our support service via E-Mail,
telling us what you use your computer for, so we can help you choose the right
edition.

Alternatively, you can look at the below table to compare editions and make the
right decision based on the information there. As a general "rule of thumb" it
is always better to first buy the small edition and then upgrade with the need.

## Getting started

### System requirements

In order to run the Zhengdu screen reader efficiently, your computer must meet some basic requirements. They are outlined below

- Operating system: Windows 7 service pack 1 or never
- RAM: 2048 MB
- Disk space: 300 MB
- Internet connection (for online editions)
- A soundcard

These are the recommended technical requirements, yet if you are a computer beginner, you might need some more special equipment in order to make your life easier. Specifically it is recommended to get a desktop keyboard in case you use a laptop. It is because the keyboard is larger and easier to learn and it contains additional block of keys known as the Num Pad. If you are not sure whether your keyboard contains a numpad, check if there is a square block at the righthand of the device. If there isn't, visit the nearest computer shop and ask for a keyboard with a numpad.

### Keyboard description

The below section contains a rough description of a standard desktop keyboard. When reading, please keep in mind that there are different keyboard variations, and so the below description might not be 100 percent accurate. It is provided here mostly for sighted people to help them learn how to describe the keyboard to a blind person.
The most upper row of the keyboard starts with the ESCAPE (ESC) key. It is located at the upper left corner of the keyboard. It is mostly used to cancel operations, go back to the previous menu, ETC.
Going right from the ESC key we have 12 functional keys, labeled F1 to F12. Sometimes they are grouped by 4, allowing for easier distinction. They are used to perform various operations. They are most often paired with other keys to create keyboard sequences, known also as keyboard shortcuts.
More to the right, we have 3 more keys. These are "PRINTSCREEN", "SCROLLOCK" and "PAUSE" keys. PRINTSCREEN is used to create screenshots (photos of your screen). SCROLLOCK is mostly historical and so does not have much use now, unless specified differently by a software program, and PAUSE is used to stop and resume operation of ZDSR.
The second row, often called the number row starts with a tilde (prim) key.
To the right of PRIM, we have 10 number keys, labeled from 1 to 0 respectively.
The remaining 3 keys in this row are minus, equal sign and "BACKSPACE". BACKSPACE is used to delete a character that is located to the left of the cursor, it can perform other operations depending on the currently running software program as well.
To the right of the "BACKSPACE" key we have a rectangular block of 6 keys. The first row of this block starts with the "INSERT" key, known as the "ZDSR key" in this book. The key next to it is called "HOME" and is used to go back to the beginning of the current line when editing text, or to the beginning of a list when in the list view. The last key in this row is the "PGUP" key. It is used to go one page up when editing text, or go twenty items up when in the list view.
The second row of the small block starts with the "DELETE"(DEL) key. This key is used to delete one character that is located to the left of the cursor when editing text or to delete the currently selected item when in the files view. The next key is called "END" and is used to go to the end of the current line when editing text, or to the end of the list when in the list view. The last key of this block is the "PGDOWN" (PAGE DOWN) key. It is used to go one page up when editing text, or twenty items up when in a list view.
When going right from the PGUP key, there is a large, square block of keys. This block is called a numpad and it largely reflects a phone keyboard, yet put upside down. We will start exploring the numpad from its upper left corner. The first key is called the "NUMLOCK" key and it is used to switch the functions which the numpad performs. For now the only thing you need to know about it is that when it is on, it is used to type numbers and when it is off, it performs different operations.
The next 3 keys are division sign, multiplication sign, minus, respectively.
The next row contains keys 7, 8, 9 as well as the plus sign. The plus sign is a long key, which is taking two rows in most of cases.
The below row contains keys 4, 5, 6. The middle key is a bit special, because it contains a little bump which makes it easily locatable.
One row below we have keys 1, 2, 3 respectively as well as the key known as the NUMPAD ENTER. This key is another long key, and so it takes up the rest of the vertical space of the keyboard.
The last row of the numpad starts with the key 0, and to its right we have the "DECIMAL" key.
Let's go back to the main keyboard for now. One key down from the forementioned "PRIM", we have the "TAB" key. This key is very important, as it is used to navigate forward in the Microsoft Windows operating system. When editing text though, the "TAB" key is used to move everything to the right of it 4 spaces. To the right of it we have a row of keys consisting of 13 keys. These are "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "[ (Left square bracket)", "] (Right square bracket" and "\ (Backslash)" keys.
The below row starts with the "CAPSLOCK" key. This key is used to toggle whether the letters you type are capitalized or not. When this is on, you type in capital letters, otherwise you don't. To the right we have other letters and symbols, namely "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", "; (Semicolon)" and "' (apostrophe). The last key in this row is very important. It is called "ENTER" and it is used to accept choices, or going one line down when editing text.
The next row of keys starts and ends with a long key. These keys are called "LEFT SHIFT" and "RIGHT SHIFT" respectively. They are used in conjunction with letters in order to capitalize them. If "CAPSLOCK" is turned on though, holding "SHIFT" and pressing letters makes them lowercase. Between the shift keys we have the following keys: "Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", ", (Comma)", ". (Dot)", "/ (slash).
The lowest row of the keyboard contains some keys that are mostly used in conjunction with other keys, creating keyboard sequences, known also as keyboard shortcuts.

- LCTRL (LEFT CONTROL): This key located in the bottom left corner of the keyboard does nothing by itself when operating 	the computer without ZDSR. When the application is active though, it silences its speech.
- LWIN (LEFT WINDOWS KEY): A key with the Microsoft Windows logo on most keyboards. It opens the "Start Menu" of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
- LALT (LEFT ALT): This key opens the default menu bar in most applications.
- SPACE: This is the longest key of the keyboard. It is used to input the "space" character when editing text, or to activate interface elements when navigating with the keyboard.
- RALT (RIGHT ALT): Pressing this key is the same as pressing the "LCTRL+LALT" key combination. It is also used in conjunction with letters to input diacritic characters on non-english keyboards.
- RWIN (RIGHT WINDOWS KEY): This key does the same function as the "LWIN" key unless otherwise specified by a software application.
- APPS (APPLICATIONS KEY): This key is used to open context menus in most applications. In case of the apsence of this key, the "SHIFT+F10" combination might be used instead.
- RCTRL (RIGHT CONTROL): Behaves in the same way as the "LCTRL" key unless otherwise specified by the software application.

The last element of the keyboard we haven't covered yet are the arrows. They are situated between the "RCTRL" and "NUMPAD 0" keys and form an upward facing triangle, or a printed "T" letter. The upmost key in this triangular block is the "UP ARROW": This key is used to go up one line when editing text, or go to the previous list element when in the list view. Below it we have the DOWN ARROW, to the left of it there's the LEFT ARROW, and to the right the RIGHT ARROW. Their function are the same, but covering their respective sides.

### Downloading ZDSR

If you have purchased the software or want to use the screen reader's free edition you first need to download it from the Internet. Downloading makes a file hosted on an Internet server available on your computer, which makes it easily usable by you. If you have another screen reader active on your machine, open your favorite web browser and navigate to [https://zdsr24.com](This URL).
Then navigate to the "Download" link. From there, the various editions of the screen reader are listed as Level 3 headings. Choose your edition and select its "Download" link under its heading in order to begin the download process. An alternative method is to type a special address in the browser's address bar. This method will allow to download the given edition extremely quickly. The below table contains all available addresses that can be typed.

| Edition | Download Link |
| ----- | ----- |
| Free edition | [free.zdsr24.com](https://free.zdsr24.com) |
| Youth edition | [youth.zdsr24.com](https://youth.zdsr24.com) |
| Commercial edition | [commercial.zdsr24.com](https://commercial.zdsr24.com) |
 : A list of short download links

In case you do not have an active screen reader at the moment, it is highly recommended that you ask a sighted person for assistance. They can either go to the main website of the screen reader located at address [www.zdsr24.com](https://zdsr24.com) or use any of the short addresses provided above.

### Installing ZDSR

Downloading the screen reader does not make it possible to use it yet. Before using, you need to install it. Installing a software means that your computer will take some special preparations and instructions from the software (ZDSR in this case) in order to prepare your environment for it.
If you have another screen reader, remember to close it shortly after executing the installer, as shortcut key conflicts might occur. After pressing the ENTER key on the installer file you should hear speech. If you don't, wait a few seconds, press "E" as "English" and press enter. This problem occurs if ZDSR could not find your language in its database.
After hearing the speech prompt, you have two choices. You can proceed with an "express installation". This method is recommended if you are a beginner and/or you never installed a software program before. To execute the express installation, press "Y" to trigger the installation process. Wait a few minutes and the program will be installed on your computer. If you wish to execute the standard installation though, press "N" after hearing the first speech prompt. Then the standard installation dialog will appear. You can navigate it by pressing the "TAB" key on your keyboard. You activate various options by pressing "SPACE". All installation screens are described below.
The first screen is just an introduction. You can press the "N" key in order to navigate to the next screen.
The second screen asks you to accept the license agreement of ZDSR. If you wish to accept the agreement, press "ALT" together with "A"
The third screen shows what's new in the version of ZDSR you are currently installing. You can press "N" again in order to navigate to the next screen.
The next screen is a bit more complicated though. It shows the list of additional tasks the installation program can perform during the installation process. The table describing them is outlined below, together with their description as well as a default value, in case you have unwillingly changed something.
Please keep in mind that "Checked" in this case means "on" or "enabled", while "Unchecked" means "off" or "disabled".
| Option name | Option description | Default value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Create desktop icon | Creates a desktop icon on your desktop. This makes it possible to quickly launch the program from the area which is visible easily. | Checked |
| Start with Windows | Enabling this option makes it so that your computer starts speaking automatically right after its turned on. | Checked |
| Read Windows logon window and security window | Controls whether ZDSR reads the secure screens of the Microsoft Windows operating system. If you don't know what this option is, leave it be. | Checked |
| Install Skyvoice TTS engine | Installs the Skyvoice TTS engine, a high quality Chinese and english voice. | Checked |
| Install IBM ViaVoice TTS Engine | Installs the English Eloquence synthesizer. | Checked |
| Install IBM Chinese TTS Engine | Installs the Chinese Eloquence synthesiser. | Checked |
| Install Mini Dog driver | Installs a driver for the dongle, a device which authorizes your ZDSR license. If you use the online edition, or the free edition of ZDSR, you can freely uncheck this option. | Checked |
 : Detailed description of the installer's options

After making any special amendments to the component list, you can press "N" again to continue.
The final screen of the installer shows the summary of all selected options. After review, press "I" to start the installation process.
As with the "Express Installation" mode, music  will start playing and the installation process will be finished shortly after.

### Activating ZDSR (Youth edition only)

if you have purchased ZDSR Youth edition you need to activate it before using. Software activation is like checking in at an airport. You show your ticket, the customs officers  check if everything is fine and you can pass further. Here it works very much like that: you launch the software, enter the key you have been provided and depending on its validity you are "let through" or "turned down". Upon registering your purchase we have sent you an E-Mail containing very important data. Please save this E-Mail letter in a safe place, as disclosing the information in it will lead to lose all of your obtained rights. Please also note down the key (a long string of numbers), an a password consisting of four digits. Albeit it is possible to recover these data in an emergency, it is recommended that you keep them well-guarded.
In order to activate your software you first need to run it. Running or "launching" a software means that it starts working either in the background (you do not directly see the exact steps the program performs) or in the foreground (you see and can control everything). ZDSR, being a screenreading application performs mainly in the background. You don't see how it "talks" to your computer, how it retrieves the information and how it generates speech. You just hear the program speaking. With that out of the way, let's finally run the program. There are many ways to do so, depending on the options you have set in the installer. The most common options are listed below.

- Press the shortcut "LCTRL+LALT+I" on your keyboard. This is the easiest method, as you do not have to memorize any positions. you just press these three keys together, wait a few seconds and the program is launched with a sound.
-  Find the "Zhengdu Screenreader Youth Edition" on your desktop. If, for some reason you cannot or do not want to use the keyboard sequence, you can find the appropriate icon and execute it by pressing "ENTER". You can go to your desktop by pressing the "LWIN+D" key sequence. After doing so, press letters "Z, H, E" in quick succession and finally press enter.
- Launch "Zhengdu Screenreader Youth Edition" from the "Start menu" (Windows 8/8.1/10 only). If you are not certain about going to the desktop  and pressing many keys in quick succession, there's an easier method. First, press the "LWIN" key on your keyboard. Then, type "zhengdu" and press enter. After waiting a few seconds you should hear the program's starting sound and speech.

Regardless of the method chosen, after listening to  the program's starting tone and the speech prompt saying the program's version (a version is a number representing how many changes have been made to the program since its release. Do not worry about it for now), you will be placed in the activation window. This window behaves similarly as the software installer. You use the "TAB" key to move forward in a window and the "SPACE" key to activate various elements. The below table describes the activation window from top to bottom, allowing you to quickly familiarize yourself with it and complete the activation process

| Option | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Activation method: | here you can control what method you use to activate your copy of ZDSR. You can activate either via authorisation key (default), or via SMS (works only in China for now). Please do not change this option unless specifically instructed by a support agent. |
| Authorisation key: | Here you can enter your authorisation key (longer of the two numbers provided in an E-Mail). |
| Authorisation password: | Here you can enter your four digit password we provided in an E-Mail. |
| OK | Validates the provided information. On success this options activates your copy of ZDSR. |
| Cancel | Abords the activation process, exiting ZDSR. |
 : Description of the ZDSR Youth activation window.

### Troubleshooting activation problems (Youth edition only)

In case of an error message during the activation process, please check the following things.

- Do you have an active Internet connection? ZDSR Youth edition requires an active Internet connection during the activation process. If you have just downloaded ZDSR then there's a very high chance your Internet connection is already working.
- Have you entered the authorisation key correctly? Remember that when entering your authorisation data, you must be 100 percent accurate. Please check whether both your key and password are entered exactly as written in an E-Mail.
- In case of any further problems, please feel free to contact the Zhengdu Screenreader Support service via E-Mail. It would help if you would include the error message displayed on the screen. You can either rewrite it or copy and paste it to an E-Mail. If you cannot copy and paste, don't worry. Just rewrite it from your memory.

### First start

It's high time you finally start learning how to use the Zhengdu Screenreader. If you have purchased the Youth Edition of the program, you have it activated and running by now, if you are using the commercial edition though, you need to plug in the received dongle to one of the USB ports of your desktop computer or laptop. Keep in mind that the device must always be plugged in to your USB port, otherwise ZDSR will exit after a while. Think about the dongle as both a key and a battery. When it is plugged in, ZDSR receives all the necessary information and so it works correctly. In any other case it "gets lost" and so it turns itself off. In order to start using  your software you first need to run it. Running or "launching" a software means that it starts working either in the background (you do not directly see the exact steps the program performs) or in the foreground (you see and can control everything). ZDSR, being a screenreading application performs mainly in the background. You don't see how it "talks" to your computer, how it retrieves the information and how it generates speech. You just hear the program speaking. With that out of the way, let's finally run the program. There are many ways to do so, depending on the options you have set in the installer. The most common options are listed below.

- Press the shortcut "LCTRL+LALT+U" (for the Commercial version) or "LCTRL+LALT+I" (for the free version) on your keyboard. This is the easiest method, as you do not have to memorize any positions. you just press these three keys together, wait a few seconds and the program is launched with a sound.
-  Find the "Zhengdu Screenreader" (for the Commercial version) or "Zhengdu Screenreader Public Welfare Version" (for the free version) on your desktop. If, for some reason you cannot or do not want to use the keyboard sequence, you can find the appropriate icon and execute it by pressing "ENTER". You can go to your desktop by pressing the "LWIN+D" key sequence. After doing so, press letters "Z, H, E" in quick succession and finally press enter.
- Launch "Zhengdu Screenreader" (for the Commercial version) or "Zhengdu Screenreader Public Welfare Version" (for the free version) from the "Start menu" (Windows 8/8.1/10 only). If you are not certain about going to the desktop  and pressing many keys in quick succession, there's an easier method. First, press the "LWIN" key on your keyboard. Then, type "zhengdu" and press enter. After waiting a few seconds you should hear the program's starting sound and speech.

Regardless of the method you chose you will hear the program's starting music and shortly after a speech prompt telling you the software version. A program's version is the numeric representation of changes that have been made since the software's first release. Do not worry about it for now. After hearing the information you will be put in the "Welcome window" of the Zhengdu screenreader. This window contains the most useful settings for the novice users. You navigate the window traditionally with the "TAB" key and you use the "SPACE" key to activate various elements. The below table describes the welcome window, along with the default values of the settings (if applicable).

## ZDSR basics

### Understanding basic keyboard navigation

Blind people operate the computer somewhat differently than the sighted. They take advantage of the powerful keyboard shortcut system built-in to the Microsoft Windows operating system, while the sighted people point and click various elements with the mouse, a small device plugged in to the USB port of your computer which can be moved and clicked in order to manipulate the computer's interface. The most basic way of the keyboard navigation is something we have already practised in the previous chapter, and this is the "TAB" navigation. You can use this key to navigate forward in the software application. The "SHIFT+TAB" key combination though, will allow you to navigate backwards in a software application.
As a small practise you can start ZDSR (LCTRL+LALT+U for the commercial edition or LCTRL+LALT+I for the Youth or free edition), and move arround the previously covered "Welcome window". When you press the "TAB" key for the first time, you will hear the following prompt:

> show welcome window At Startup Checkbox Checked

This prompt means that your cursor (a small arrow designating where you are in the window) has moved to the option "show welcome window at startup". You can press the "TAB" key to hear the following prompt:

> Start with Windows  Checkbox Checked

Another movement of the cursor. This time, do not press the "TAB" key to move forward. Instead, press the "SHIFT+TAB" combination. Make a mental note of what you have heard and make sure you have understood the concept correctly, as it is crucial to understand the computer, and work with it well.
The second basic thing we need to cover are the textboxes, lists, sliders, radio buttons  and comboboxes. You of course do not need to understand these concepts for now. What they have in common though is that all of them are operated using the arrow keys. The most simple control of all of these is the text box and so we will practise on it.
Use the skills you have gained in the previous section to place your cursor on the "Briew introduction of ZDSR" element. As you can hear the screenreader reads the whole text at once! And what if you were reading a book?
This is where the arrow keys come to the rescue. In this section, we will call them the "directional keys", because this will help you understand their function better.
"UP" and "DOWN" arrows are used to read the text line by line. "DOWN ARROW" reads the next line, while the "UP ARROW" reads the previous one. Practise this here. As soon as you press the "DOWN ARROW" you will hear the following:

> operate their computer. The program comes in several editions, namely the public welfare 

This is the second line of the text placed in the text box we are currently viewing. Imagine the situation that you do not exactly get the spelling of a word. In such a case you can use the "LEFT" and "RIGHT" arrow keys to move to the previous and next character of a current line (respectively). Another interesting function of the arrow keys is moving between words in the document. When you press the "LCTRL" together with the "LEFT" or the "RIGHT" arrow, you will move to either the previous or the next word. Yet another function connected with the arrows is the ability to move between paragraphs. When you press the "LCTRL" key together with the "UP" or the "DOWN" arrow, ZDSR will read the previous or the next paragraph, respectively. Unfortunately we cannot test this feature here, as this text is just a single paragraph.
In case of problems with remembering these key combinations, please learn the following:

- Lines are vertical, so i use the "UP" and "DOWN" arrows to move between them, just like I would read in braille. If I wanted to move to the next line, I would put my hand slightly down.
- Characters are horizontal, so I use the "LEFT" and "RIGHT" arrows to move between them.
- A paragraph consists of many lines, so I use the "LCTRL" key together with either the "UP" or "DOWN" arrow to move between them.
- A word consists of many characters, so I use the "LCTRL" key together with either the "LEFT" or "RIGHT" arrow to move between them.

There is only one group of keys we need to master for now. These are the "HOME", "END", "PG UP" and "PG DOWN" keys located in a rectangular block of the keyboard, straight up from the "UP ARROW" key.
The first key you will encounter when navigating up from the "UP ARROW" key is the "END" key. It either goes to the last character in a current line, when pressed on a textbox, or to the end of a list, when used in a list control.
When going one key right from the "END" key you will encounter the "PG DOWN (PAGE DOWN)" key. This key in turn is used to go one page down (as the name implies) when on a text box, or it can skip twenty lines down when on a list control.
Going up from "PAGE DOWN" you have the "PG UP (PAGE UP)" key. As the name implies, it is used to go one page up when on a textbox, or it can skip twenty items up when on a list control.
And finally when going left from "PG UP" you will meet the "HOME" key. This key is used to go to the beginning of a current line when on a textbox or it can skip to the very beginning of a list when on a list control.
It's not all though. If you press the "HOME" key together with the "LCTRL" key it will go to the very beginning of a document that you are currently reading.
And so when you press the "END" key together with the "LCTRL" key it will go to the very end of the document you are currently reading.
In case of problems with remembering these key combinations, please learn the following:

- A home can be associated with the beginning, so the "HOME" key goest o the first character of a current line or to the beginning of a list.
- The name of the "END" key is very appropriate,. This key goes to the last character of the current line, or to the end of a list when in a list control.
- The "PG UP" key, called also the "PAGE UP" key is used to go one page up when on a text box. When in a list control though, it is used to skip twenty items up.
- The "PG DOWN" key, called also the "PAGE DOWN" key is used to go one page down when on a text box. When in a list control though, it is used to skip twenty items down.
- Both "HOME" and "END" keys, when pressed together with the "LCTRL" key will go either to the beginning or the end of the document I am currently reading.

#### Practise the basic keyboard navigation

Sections like this will provide you with some basic exercises, so you can apply the knowledge you have acquired when reading the previous section or chapter. Sometimes the exercises are simple and so the answers are basically at your fingertips, while other times they might be a little bit harder, requiring you to do your own research, either by going back in this book or reading any recommended material.
This first exercise will be about launching the Zhengdu Screen reader from the desktop.
A desktop is the area that is first visible when your computer starts up. If you have installed ZDSR with default options, an icon for it has been placed on it. If you wish to open the desktop, press the "LWIN+D" key combination.
Tip: The desktop is a special case of a control that is called a grid. A grid in this case means that you can move in all four directions, and so locating the icon you want might not be so easy. Is there another way I can open ZDSR from the desktop?

### Understanding the "ZDSR Key"

The "ZDSR Key" is a very important concept to understand, if you want to master the screen reader as well as possible. The "ZDSR key" can be thought of as a master key for ZDSR, meaning that most keys pressed in conjunction with this key will control a given ZDSR behavior.
This explanation is a bit simplified, but for now it is enough to get you up and running.
By default, ZDSR has three keys assigned to itself. You might be wondering: "Why do three keys have to be assigned to the screen reader? Do I really have to learn all of them?"
The answer to this question is rather simple and, fortunately for you, also helpful, Learning all three ZDSR keys is not mandatory. They are here for your convenience. If you need to work with just one hand you might be using the "CAPSLOCK" key as the ZDSR key, but if you need a more comfortable position, you can always go for the "NUMPAD ZERO" key. With that out of the way, let's see what keys are assigned to ZDSR.
First of all, the "capslock" key: in most cases it is the fourth key when going down from the very top left corner of the keyboard. By default it allows you to type a series of capital letters without having to  hold down the "SHIFT" key/. It does not lose this function when used as the "ZDSR key". When you press "CAPSLOCK" with any key which creates a correct ZDSR command, then it is intercepted and handled by the screen reader.
Secondly, the "NUMPAD ZERO" key: it is generally the third key when going left from the very bottom right of the keyboard. Please keep in mind that "NUMLOCK" has to be off for the key to behave as a ZDSR key. If the "NUMLOCK" is on instead, this key will just type the number 0.
The last of the three ZDSR keys is the "INSERT" key. It is located to the left of the "HOME" key, so it's the top left key of the little rectangular block located above the arrow keys. This key has no other special function in Windows, and so it is always reserved for ZDSR.

#### Practising use of the "ZDSR key"

The point of this exercise is to make yourself comfortable with all three ZDSR keys. This exercise will be simple and easy, but it will let you see which of the three available ZDSR keys is the best for you.
Press the "ZDSR+Z" key combination (substituting "ZDSR" with each of the ZDSR keys), then press "ESCAPE" and repeat the process for the remaining keys.

### Understanding the "ZDSR menu"

Before delving into all the details of this topic, we need to answer the question: "What is the "ZDSR Menu"?" Imagine a central hub, from where all the commands can be executed. It's very much like a control panel of a washing machine or a dishwasher, where the series of buttons allows you to execute the devices' most used features. The principle works in the exactly same manner here.
In order to open the "ZDSR menu" you need to press the "ZDSR+Z" key combination. Remember to substitute "ZDSR" with any of the three available ZDSR keys. After doing that, you will hear the following prompt:

> ZDSR Settings(S)... 

This prompt means that your cursor is  on the "ZDSR Settings..." option, and its shortcut key is the letter "S". Remember that thought pattern when analyzing further menu options, as it will be useful not only in ZDSR itself, but also in other software applications we will explore in this book, or the ones you will use by yourself.
Menus have some nomenclature concerning them, but for now we need to learn only about one term. This term is "popup menu". A "popup menu" is nothing morre than a "child" of a main menu, or a "branch" of a tree. In our computer world it means that there's a new road in place of such menu, and so we can press the "RIGHT ARROW" to expand such menu. As a trivia its worth remembering that a "popup menu" is sometimes called a "submenu", so it's something smaller, branching of something bigger. If you would want to go back from a submenu though, you can use either the "LEFT ARROW" or you can "ESCAPE" from it.
Even though the "ZDSR menu" has some submenus (three, to be exact), in this section we will not cover them, as the options behind them are hidden for a reason. Don't worry though; we will be going back to the "ZDSR Menu" probably throughout the rest of this book. This section is intended to to give you a good understanding of the concept, as well as to help you create a little map in your mind. We will circle important points of interests on it with time, but for now we will just mark some roads, so you know where to go and how to go back when lost.
In order to navigate the menu, you use the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys, just like "NORTH" and "SOUTH" on the compass. If you encounter a submenu, you can expand it with the "RIGHT ARROW", or collapse it with the "LEFT ARROW", just like east and west on the compass. The below table describes all the top-level options of the "ZDSR Menu". As said above, contents of the submenus will remain hidden for now, yet you can explore by yourself if you so wish. Remember not to press the "ENTER" key on options you do not understand, as you can really break your working environment. Be careful!!!

## Customizing ZDSR voice

### Some theory behind the TTS engines

Before setting up your personal voice configuration, you need to understand how Text-To-Speech works. Learning this will help you control the voices better, as well as it will make it possible for you to make more conscious decisions while setting things up.
Each Text-To-Speech voice is described by three main parameters. They are outlined below, together with their short description.

| Parameter name | Parameter description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Volume | Controls how loud the voice is. It is important to acknowledge that only the volume of the sound is affected by this value. TTS engines don't change their intonation based on this parameter, meaning that the 100% volume will not yield an angry tone. In ZDSR, 0% is a minimal volume, while 100% is the maximum volume supported by a given text-to-speech engine. |
| Speed | Affects how fast the given text-to-speech engine speaks. Each TTS engine has its own internal value for this parameter and so the results may warry from engine to engine. |
| Pitch | Affects the tone of the TTS engine. The higher the value, the more "child-like" the voice. Please keep in mind that when setting this parameter to an unreasonably high or low value, sound artifacts might occur which will disturb your reading experience. |
: Description of various text-to-speech parameters

### Understanding the concept of voice schemes

A voice scheme is a set of various settings which describe a text-to-speech engine (see above). You might have different schemes for different scenarios. For example, a slower, more natural voice for reading books or magazines, and a fast, robotic voice for browsing the Internet or typing with friends.
In other words, a voice scheme is a person that you bring to life in your computer, in order to help you read the screen.

### Voice customization dialog

In order to open the voice customization dialog, you need to first launch ZDSR.
If you haven't done it yet, please launch it by either pressing "LCTRL+LALT+U" for the commercial version, or "LCTRL+LALT+I" for the Youth or the free version or, alternatively, launching the software from the desktop.
Once it is up and running, please open the "ZDSR Menu" by pressing the "ZDSR+Z" key combination on your keyboard.
After opening the "ZDSR Menu", you can either navigate to the "Voice Scheme..." option with your "DOWN ARROW" or alternatively press the letter "V" directly on your keyboard. No matter which road you choose, the voice customization dialog will open.
The below table shows all the options of the voice customization dialog, together with their descriptions. You can navigate the dialog with the "TAB" or the "SHIFT+TAB" key combinations and activate various elements with the "SPACE bar"..

| Option name | Option description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Voice scheme | Allows you to select which profile is currently in use, as well as which profile you want to edit. You can change between your profiles with the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys. Please keep in mind that when changing the profile, the change is immediately applied, meaning that the program immediately starts speaking with the new profile. |
| Test | Allows you to audit the currently selected profile. Activating this button will make your profile speak a short phrase displaying the settings which make up this profile. |
| New | Opens the "New scheme" dialog, allowing you to create a new voice profile. |
| Rename | Allows you to change the name of the currently selected voice profile. |
| Delete | Deletes the currently selected voice profile, making it no longer visible nor usable. |
| Capital settings | Opens the dialog allowing you to customize settings regarding announcement of the capital letters in a currently selected voice profile. |
| Main voice | Allows you to select any voice installed on your computer for the currently selected voice profile. Here the changes are not immediately applied, so you can audit them before applying them. |
| Volume | Controls the volume of the currently selected voice profile. |
| Speed | Controls the speed of the currently selected voice profile. |
| Pitch | Controls the pitch of the currently selected voice profile. |
| Enable second voice for the scheme | Allows you to create a "dual voice profile", meaning that two voices can be used simultaneously. |
| Second voice | Shown only when "Enable second voice for the scheme" is selected, allows you to select a secondary voice for the currently selected voice profile. |
| Second volume | Shown only when "Enable second voice for the scheme" is selected, controls the volume of the secondary voice used in the currently selected voice profile. |
| Second speed | Shown only when "Enable second voice for the scheme" is selected, controls the speed of the secondary voice in the currently selected voice profile. |
| Second pitch | Shown only when "Enable second voice for the scheme" is selected, controls the pitch of the secondary voice in the currently selected voice profile. |
| OK | Saves any changes you have made in the currently selected voice profile and closes the customization dialog. |
| Cancel | Discards any changes you have made to the currently selected voice profile and closes the customization dialog. |
| Apply | Saves any changes you have made to the currently selected voice profile, but leaves the customization dialog open for further changes. |

### Creating a new voice profile

If you have already familiarized yourself with the "Voice customization dialog", let's now create a new voice profile in order to practice the newly acquired knowledge.
First of all, you of course need to open the "ZDSR Menu" with the "ZDSR+Z" key combination. Then, either press the letter "V" directly, or navigate to the "Voice Scheme" option with your arrow keys. No matter which road you went, the well-known customization dialog will open.
Now we need to select the "New" option. There are two ways you can do it. The first one is by pressing the "LALT+N" key combination. If you were carefully listening to voice prompts given by ZDSR while navigating arround the "Voice customization dialog" you probably heard that after speaking some options it also said something along the lines of "alt+n". This means that such shortcut is available for a given element, and so pressing it is equal to navigating to it with the "TAB" key and pressing "SPACE" in order to activate it.
If you wish, you can of course use the very same method to find the "New" option and press space to activate it.
No matter which road you went by, the "New voice scheme" dialog will open, allowing you to create the scheme.
The first option in this window is called "Name", As the name implies, it allows you to "name your newly created person". In this example, let's name this profile "book profile".
After navigating further down the window with the "TAB" key, you will hear the following prompt

> Single Voice RadioButton Checked

This means that your newly created profile will use only one voice to speak. If you wanted to create a dual voice profile, you would change the setting with the "DOWN" arrow key. However, for simplicity it is recommended to leave the default setting for now.
Press the "TAB" key once again and you will land on the "OK" button. Pressing it will set up your new profile with its default settings, allowing for further customizations. If you have carried out all the previous steps, press the "SPACE" key here in order to set up your new profile and return to the "Voice customization dialog".
Now we need to select a new voice for our newly created profile. In order to do so, navigate with the "TAB" key till you find the "Main voice" option. Now, select any voice with the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys. In this example, just select the voice whose name you like.
Further down the window there are the options to manipulate the volume, speed and pitch of the currently selected voice profile; yet since this is just an example, it is recommended to leave them be for now, but of course you can freely manipulate these options. Just be careful with the speed and make sure you can understand the voice before applying any changes.
After everything is ready, press the "TAB" key till you find the "OK" element. Press the "SPACE" key to activate it and... Voila! Now ZDSR speaks with your newly created voice profile.

### Creating a "Dual voice profile"

If you speak many languages, you might sometimes need to read two of them at the same time. The "Dual voice profile" concept is created just for scenarios like that. The idea is that the "Main voice" is used for your primary language, and the "Secondary voice" is used for the secondary language. But even if you speak only one language, this function might have advantages that we are going to explore later on in this book.
If you wish to create a "Dual voice profile" the first thing is of course to open the "ZDSR Menu" and then the "Voice Customization dialog". This time the exact steps are not given. If you need to review this material, please se above.
When the "Voice customization dialog" is opened, navigate with the "TAB" key till you find the "new" element. Activate it with the "Space key". When the "New voice scheme" dialog opens, fill its name in the text box and navigate further with the "TAB" key.
This time, when reaching "Single voice" setting, navigate with the "DOWN ARROW". You will hear a prompt saying "Double Voices RadioButton Checked". This means that your intention is to create a dual voice profile. Press "TAB" once more and confirm your setting by pressing the "SPACE" bar on the "OK" element.
After doing this, you will be returned to the already well-known "Voice customization dialog.". In order to set various parameters for your shiny new dual voice profile, navigate with the "TAB" key till you land on the "Main Voice" element. Here, choose the voice you want to use most often (most probably a voice in your primary language). Further down the window you can adjust parameters such as the volume, speed or pitch of the main voice of the currently selected voice profile. Navigating further down will reveal another set of options. These options are strictly related to the secondary voice of the voice profile. You can choose the secondary voice, secondary volume, speech and the pitch here.
After choosing all the necessary parameters, please save your settings by pressing the "SPACE" bar on the "OK" element.

### Deleting a voice profile

Sometimes you might find that you no longer need a voice profile you had previously created. In this case, you can delete such a profile, making it unusable, and so reclaiming the space it occupied.
In order to delete an existing voice profile, first of all you need to get to the "Voice customization dialog". To do that, you obviously need to open the "ZDSR Menu" and press the letter "V". Once it is open, you need to select the profile you want deleted (use the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys to select the profile) and press the "LALT+D" key combination. After doing that the profile will vanish from the list and you will be switched to the next available profile. If there are no more profiles, ZDSR will revert back to its factory voice.

### Renaming a voice profile

Sometimes you might find that the name you initially gave to the voice profile is no longer appropriate. In such a case you can use the "Rename" element from the "Voice customization dialog".
After the dialog is open, first of all you need to select the voice profile you want to rename. Switch to the appropriate profile with the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys. Once focused, navigate with the "TAB" key till you land on the "Rename" element. Press the "SPACE" bar to activate it. A new window will open, allowing you to carry out renaming. Right after it is opened, you can type a new name for the profile. When done, press the "ENTER" key to accept the rename, or the "ESCAPE" key to abort the operation and go back to the "Voice customization dialog".

### Customizing announcements for capital letters

When proofreading texts, it is very important to know whether the character you are on is lowercase or not. Zhengdu Screen reader provides a very rich and configurable notification system, which will help you obtain this information very quickly and accurately. If you have followed the whole book carefully, you have already stumbled upon a case, where some characters have been read with a higher tone than the rest of the characters.
In this section we will explore the "Capital announcement customization window" and explain various options it contains.
In order to get to this window, first of all you need to open the aforementioned "Voice customization dialog". In order to do that, open the "ZDSR Menu" with the "ZDSR+Z" key combination and press the letter "V".
Once in the "Voice customization dialog", please navigate with the "TAB" key until you get to the "Capital settings" element. Activating it with the "SPACE" key will bring up the "Capital announcement customization window". All options contained in it are outlined below, together with their short description as well as the default value for the settings.

| Option name | Option description | Default value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Read out "Capital" | When checked, the program will announce the capitalization of the current character by saying the word "capital" before it. | Unchecked |
| Play sound | When checked, the program will announce the capitalization of the current character by playing a sound when reading it. | Unchecked |
| Raise the pitch | When checked, the program will announce the capitalization of the current character by changing the pitch of the currently selected text-to-speech engine. | Checked |
| Pitch | Here you can type in the pitch which will be used for reading capital letters. The range goes from 0 to 100. | 70 |
: Description of the "Capital announcement customization window"

Please keep in mind that these options can be combined together, meaning that you can make ZDSR to play a sound, as well as to raise up the pitch of the synthesizer when encountering a capital letter.

### Managing voice settings on the fly

Doing something "on the fly" in the computer world simply means that you can do something instantly, without hesitation or without aborting of the operation currently in progress. Naturally, managing the currently used voice profile, or even switching to another one must be realized as quickly and conveniently as possible because there might be situations, where you'll want to do it many times in a relatively short time.
In order to handle such scenarios, ZDSR provides you with many hotkeys related to voice management. They will be described below, but for the sake of readability, a more conversational style will be used rather than our conventional table. This is because many new concepts have to be introduced.
The first concept is that of a"hotkey group". A hotkey group is just a design road taken up by ZDSR which groups hotkeys in easy-to-memorize groups, making them similar for your mind to remember.
And so the hotkey group used for managing the currently selected voice profile is "ZDSR+LCTRL+X", where "X" is any other key which is assigned to this group.
The "Modifier" of this group is "ZDSR+LCTRL". A "modifier" is nothing more than the "common denominator" for the group, just like the "common denominator" for English, Russian, Chinese and Italian is the fact that all of these are languages spoken by people arround the world.
Let's go back to our voice hotkey group for now though. You can use the "ZDSR+LCTRL+LEFTARROW" or "ZDSR+LCTRL+RIGHT ARROW" to decide which voice parameter you wish to change. These shortcuts can be compared to the scenario, where you move your hand arround the control panel of a washing machine to find the appropriate slider or switch.
And you can use the "ZDSR+LCTRL+UP ARROW" or "ZDSR+LCTRL+DOWN ARROW" to adjust the parameter you previously decided to change. If you think about it for a moment, you will realize that these shortcuts are extremely logical, as all three parameters (Speed, Volume and Pitch" are represented as sliders in the "Voice customization dialog".
As a practice you can slow down your voice profile a bit. In order to do that, first navigate to the "Speed" slider with the "ZDSR+LCTRL+RIGHT ARROW" key combination. Then, adjust it slightly with the "ZDSR+LCTRL+DOWN" arrow. Then you can put it back to the default value with the "ZDSR+LCTRL+UP ARROW" key combination.
As you have probably seen, ZDSR reads the value for parameters while navigating between them, as well as when adjusting them.
There are two more shortcuts you need to be aware of for now. These are "ZDSR+F9" and "ZDSR+SHIFT+F9". They are used to switch either to the next or the previous voice profile you have previously created. This allows you to switch voice profiles rapidly without the need to open the "Voice customization dialog".
There are more hotkeys relatedt o the voice management aspect of ZDSR, but they are too advanced for now. Don't worry though, as they will be explained in due time.

## Learning Windows: choosing the best software

### What's it all about?

When you opened this book for the first time, you probably assumed that it would be a dry guide on using Zhengdu Screen reader and nothing more. No! This is not the case for this book. Learning ZDSR itself is like learning how to drive. But what use does driving have, if you don't have a good road to drive on? The chapters with the title "Learning Windows" are here to teach you how to use your computer in conjunction with all the knowledge you have acquired in the main part of this book.
In the introductory chapter of this series, we'll talk more about various software programs you can have on your machine. This chapter will contain no practice whatsoever; only an introduction to various software types.

### What can your computer do?

Before starting to think about what specific programs you'll use in the future, first you need to ask yourself "What can I do with my computer?"
The answer will probably be satisfactory for you. You can really do a lot with your machine! You can read news, communicate with friends, listen to music, play chess, listen to the radio, play games and much, much more!
This chapter will give you some insight into what software is the best and most accessible with ZDSR, but the more experience you have in computers, the more likely you'll search for alternatives. Let's begin then!

### Web browser

A web browser is one of the most essential software programs you can have on your computer. It allows you to surf the beautiful Internet world and consequently access countless information! Because of that, your experience must be as smooth and painless as possible.
If you are using the Windows 10 operating system, then you have a very good bult-in browser. It's called Microsoft Edge and it can be accessed straight from your "start menu" or the "Task bar".
If you are using Windows 7 though, you will need to install a different browser. Its name is Google Chrome. It's very fast and user-friendly, and it can have countless functions thanks to its extension system.
Of course, you can install Google Chrome on Windows 10 too if you so wish, but on this operating system, this step is not necessary in order to use the computer efficiently.
The process of downloading and installing Chrome with the help of ZDSR will be covered later on in this book.

### Text editor

You can use your computer to write various kinds of texts, starting with short messages to friends or family, through school essays to full-fledged books! In fact, we write this book using exclusively a computer and ZDSR!
Microsoft Windows itself has two text bult-in editors.
The first one is called "Notepad" and is very simple. You can use it to write very short texts for your own use. It is not recommended to write anything more serious using this program. Its simplicity comes with a price of almost non-existent functions and bad-looking documents.
A slightly better option is another editor built into Windows. Its name is "Wordpad". It can be used to write basic texts and documents, but as in the case of Notepad, the generated documents are in no way pretty.
If you want to write serious and good-looking documents, then we recommend grabbing the Microsoft Office Home suite. Unfortunately this software is paid, but very often you can get it for free from various institutions, either educational or vocational. Microsoft Office will be covered in depth later on in this book.

### Mail client

Even though the Electronic mail (E-Mail) is getting less and less popular with every day, having a good mail client is essential for working with the computer efficiently. There are three options we can recommend. The first one is "Becky! Internet Mail". This program from Japan used to be paid, but now it can be obtained for free by contacting the developer. It is worth noting that becky! might be downting for some users and so it is not recommended for complete computer beginners.
The second option is "The Bat!". This software can be purchased for 40 dollars at the time of writing this book. It is much easier and more friendly to the user, but it offers less options aimed at more advanced mail users.
Last but not least there is Microsoft Outlook. This program is very advanced, its a mail client, contact software and the planning tool. It requires the valid Microsoft Office Professional license, and so it might not be an option for some.
of course, all these E-Mail clients will be covered later down this book, Outlook in the chapter dedicated to the Microsoft Office Suite, and The Bat! and becky! in the second part of this book "ZDSR and Windows: the combo you can't beat".

### File management software

No matter whether you will be writing, programming, doing sound design or just using your computer as a home entertainment center, a good file manager is an essential part of your computer life. Windows has of course file manager included (File Explorer is its name), but it is neither good, nor fast. The most accessible file manager is Total Commander. It can be bought for 40 dollars at the time of writing this book. The developers are well-aware of the accessibility and they're working very hard to fix it.
Both File Explorer and Total Commander are going to be covered in this book.
