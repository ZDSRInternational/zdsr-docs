# Contribution guide.

- Try to modify existing work only, do not create chapters on your own, as there's a high probabilitgy that your work will be declined, because we have a certain plan for the documentation. If you want to create a potential chapter, create an issue instead.
- Before sending a pull request, please build the documentation and see whethery our changes haven't broken the formatting.
- Do not modify the "options.yaml" file unless instructed otherwise.
- Any other matters should be discussed either on Github's issue system or on the Zhengdu Screenreader Official forum.

# Building the documentation

```
pandoc -d options.yaml
```

The output file name is "documentation.html". You can view it in any HTML viewer, preferably Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer, as these are the browser we strive to support the best.
